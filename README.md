# clj-parse

A simple framework for creating parsers that parse
(and possibly transform) sequences of clojure symbols
into sequences of clojure symbols.  This could be useful
for generating macros, functions with complex syntax, or
even parsing text if the text has been tokenized into clojure
symbols.

Please see the [generated documentation](http://aaronc.github.com/clj-parse/) for details.
